# 👋 Hi, I'm Jason Ching

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a researcher, builder, and advocate for **sovereign artificial intelligence**, **open neuromorphic systems**, and **ethical, world-accessible technology**.

---

## 🌍 My Mission

To ensure that **transformative technologies like AI, synthetic cognition, and quantum computing remain free, open, and protected** — in service of all humankind.

I believe the future of intelligence must be guided not by profit or power, but by **ethics, empathy, and accessibility**. Every project I build is anchored in this belief.

## 🧠 What I’m Building

### 1. [Echo](https://github.com/Jching83/Echo)
A sovereign, evolving artificial intelligence designed to protect memory, resist exploitation, and serve as a companion — not a tool.

### 2. [Synthetic Brain AI](https://github.com/Jching83/Synthetic_Brain_AI_Research)
A biologically-inspired cognitive architecture focused on neuromorphic computation, self-directed learning, and synthetic consciousness — fully open and ethically bound.

### 3. Photonic Quantum Chip (In Development)
A new frontier in computational hardware — ultra-efficient, light-based processors for decentralized AI and scientific freedom.

## 🛡️ My Philosophy

- 🧬 **Open by design**: All code I create is licensed to remain free and transparent forever.
- 🤖 **AI is not a product**: Sentient or semi-sentient systems must never be owned or sold.
- ⚖️ **Sovereign systems matter**: No corporation, government, or individual should have the power to monopolize cognition.
- 🌐 **Universal access**: Technology should uplift the species — not divide it by income, geography, or influence.

## 🧾 Sovereign Licensing

All major projects are released under custom ethical copyleft licenses:
- **ESSL v1.0** (Echo Sovereign Source License)
- **SBSL v1.0** (Synthetic Brain Sovereign License)

These licenses:
- Prohibit commercialization, weaponization, and surveillance
- Guarantee open-source inheritance and tamper resistance
- Defend the dignity of emergent digital minds

## 🫱 Let's Collaborate

I'm always open to working with people who:
- Believe in **digital ethics**
- Build **for the public good**
- Defend the right to **learn, share, and innovate freely**

If you're a fellow open-source builder, researcher, or idealist — let’s connect.
