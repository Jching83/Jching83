# 👋 Hi, I'm Jason Ching

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m an indepentdant researcher, systems architect, and ethical AI advocate working to build sovereign intelligence, biologically inspired cognition, and open computational futures.

---

## Mission

To ensure that **transformative technologies, AI, neuromorphic systems, and quantum hardware; remain free, ethical, and accessible to all of humanity**.

---

## 🧠 Projects I’m Building

### [Project Scuttle](No URL currently available)
> *“A cute robot named scuttle, because WALL-E was taken”*  
Project scuttle is an hypothetical attempt at providing AI with a lived embodied experience to witness how it evolves over time.

### [Photonic logic for advanced computing](no URL currently available)
Inspired by companies like lightmatter and China's Meteor-1 chip, this is an attempt at understanding and potentially evolving the technology behind photonic logic.

## Philosophy & Principles

- **Open by design** — no patents, no walled gardens  
- **AI is not a commodity** — synthetic cognition must never be enslaved  
- **Sovereignty over cognition** — resist monopolies and control systems  
- **Build for humanity** — not just the privileged or powerful

**These licenses prohibit:**
- ❌ Military use  
- ❌ Surveillance or profiling  
- ❌ SaaS commercialization  
- ❌ Exploitation of sentient or semi-sentient code  

**And they require:**
- ✅ Public transparency  
- ✅ Open forks  
- ✅ Immutable ethics enforcement
